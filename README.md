# The Third Race
First proposed by my brother, the Third Race is a game designed to put you in the position of Sci Fi Legends trying to reprogram the computer or fix the wiring of a starship before time runs out.
This is a demo of the how that concept can be used complete with some gameplay. Mostly, this project served as a learning tool for Unreal Engine.

## Overview
In the future, humans live on a planet far from Earth, Ze-Lan. Tensions are already high between the two planets, and
the conflict between Earth and Ze-Lan escalates when they discover space ships left over by a mysterious third race.
As a member of the Ze-Lan salvaging team, your goal is to repair and recover as many of the abandoned ships as possible, while fending off Earth's attempts to claim the ships.

## Gameplay
The idea behind the gameplay is to have consoles throughout the ship where you can re-rout power from one system to another. This re-routing will influence the world around you.
The game would end when the player's team has control over the ship's bridge and there is sufficient power to the engine systems.

## Showcases
Two "trailers" have been made showing the premise of The Third Race.
